        Hello! My name is Jami Rankinen, a 25-year-old Finnish guy with a passion for building things on the web. My journey into coding started out of curiosity, tweaking websites, experimenting with layouts, and slowly realizing how much I enjoy turning ideas into real, working projects. That curiosity grew into something more, and now I’m actively pursuing my first professional role in IT.`,
    `
        I mainly focus on frontend development, but I’m also open to exploring full-stack and backend work as I keep growing. During my first professional experience in frontend development, I got hands-on with TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while working in a team environment that used CI/CD pipelines, Jira for task management, and Slack for communication. That short time taught me a lot about collaboration and modern workflows, and it motivated me to keep pushing further.`,
    `
        Right now, my strongest tech stack includes React, TypeScript, Next.js, Vite.js, HTML, and CSS, and I’m continuously learning more — from Tailwind CSS and Vue.js to improving my JavaScript and design skills with Canva and Figma. I also enjoy working on SEO and web app development, and I’m always looking for opportunities where I can put these skills to good use.`,
    `
        Outside of coding, I’d describe myself as a friendly, motivated, and athletic nature lover. I train regularly in Muay Thai, calisthenics, climbing, running, and gym, and my biggest passion outside of tech is the mountains — I love traveling, hiking, and being close to nature. I’m also very social, enjoy spending time with friends, and I’m always open to new experiences and challenges.`,

    `
        To test my skills to the fullest would be an amazing experience, an environment where I would learn more and polish my skills more further would be an ideal one for me. Because I believe that there is always room to learn something new and to say no to a new opportunity would not be wise at all.
        Feel free to communicate.`,
