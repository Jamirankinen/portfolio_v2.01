    May 2025 I graduated from Oulu University of Applied Science as an Bachelor in Business and Information Systems focusing in multiple programming languages from Frontend all the way till Backend. I was part of many projects with real-life clients and worked in agile environments during my time at the Uni. Decided to hone my skills more in the Frontend sector including Web Development, Web Apps, Digital marketing, SEO and website optimization. Even after graduating I have kept working on honing my skills every day to become a better developer overall.`,
